## üíª Run From Source

### 1. **Dependencies**
Make sure you have `GTK+ 3` and `GtkSourceView 3` installed. On Ubuntu, run:  

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libgtk-3-dev libgtksourceview-3.0-dev
```

### 2. **Compilation**

Clone or download the source code, then build the binary (output to `bin/caecode`):  

```bash
make
```

Run Caecode after compilation:  

```bash
make run
```

Clean build artifacts:  

```bash
make clean
```

### 3. **Packaging (.deb)**

You can build a `.deb` package complete with a desktop launcher and icon:

```bash
make builddeb
```

The default package version is `0.0.4`. You can override the version at build time:

```bash
make builddeb VERSION=1.0.0
```

Install the generated `.deb` package (it will automatically build if not present):

```bash
sudo make install
```

Uninstall the package:

```bash
sudo make uninstall
```

Notes:
- The `.deb` installs the binary to `/usr/bin/caecode`.
- The desktop file is installed to `/usr/share/applications/caecode.desktop`.
- The icon is installed to `/usr/share/icons/hicolor/256x256/apps/caecode.png`.
- The launcher will appear in your applications menu as "Caecode".
